Documentation of Rules, Guidelines and Standards for our Space Engineers Faction
## Ship Regulations
### Part Requirements
* A projector with a regularly updated blueprint.
  * The projector should be set to keep the blueprint. This way, if a healthy ship gets damaged, it can easily be repaired by anyone even if they don't have the schematic.
* A *rear docking* connector
* A docking camera, preferably one block above or below the connector
### Component Regulations
#### Naming Convention
* All components must be prepended with an abbreviation for the ship's name.
  * For large ships, the zone/section of the ship should also be prepended.
    * If there are subzones that are unnamed (E.g. Hangar 01-10), the subzone number should be prepended as well. Leading zeroes must be added to maintain alphabetical sorting.  
* If there are multiple of the same components within a ship/zone/subzone, they should be appended with a unique letter. Leading letters (E.g. starting from AA) should be used only if there are more than 26 components.
##### Example:
Ship: Deltawing
Zone: Hangar 03
Part: Hangar Door (first of 10)
Name: DLT Hangar 03 Door A
#### Hiding Components
Please make sure to hide components! It eliminates a lot of the clutter in the terminal, *especially* when ships dock to a mothership. **Hiding a component does not exclude it from needing to follow the naming convention.**
* If the component is not going to be regularly accessed **individually** from the terminal, it should be hidden from the terminal.
* If the component is not going to be assigned **individually** to toolbars, it should be hidden from the toolbar config.
* Components should be hidden from the inventory screen if they are not useful at all to access.
